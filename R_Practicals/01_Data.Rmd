## Why use R?
R offers numerous advantages over Excel, GraphPad Prism & the like:  

- Can handle extremely large datasets  
- We can perform complex analytic procedures
- Many processes come as inbuilt functions  
- _We have code to record and repeat our analysis_

With this extra capability, we need to understand a little about:  

- Data Types  
- Data Structures  
- Functions  

We will also briefly touch on:  

- Reading data into R
- Visualising Data

# Introduction to RStudio

1. Open `RStudio` then
2. `File` > `New File` > `R Script`  
3. Save As `Introduction.R`


```{r, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}
include_graphics("images/RStudio.png")
```

## The Script Window

- This is just a text editor.
- We enter our commands here but they are not executed
    - We can keep a record of __everything__ we've done
    - We can also add comments to our code
    - Comments start with the `#` symbol
    
## The Console

- This is where we execute commands
- Is essentially the _"engine"_
- We can execute commands directly in the `Console` or send from the `Script Window`

## Executing Code from the Script Window

Enter the following in the `Script Window`

```{r, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
# Create our first R object
x <- 5
```

- Lines of code are sent to the `Console` by either:
    - `Ctrl + Enter`
    - Copy & Paste into the Console
    - Clicking the `Run` button at the top right

We can view the contents of the object `x` by:

- entering it's name directly in the `Console`, or 
- entering it's name in the `Script Window` & sending it to the `Console`

```{r, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE, results='hide'}
x
print(x)
```


__Where have we created the object `x`?__

- Is it on your hard drive somewhere?
- Is it in a file somewhere?

__ Answer__

- We have placed `x` in our `R Workspace` or `Environment`
- More formally known as your `Global Environment`


## The R Environment
In the R Environment, we can create objects of multiple types.
We first give them a name (e.g. `x`) and then assign a value to it using the `<-`symbol.
This is like an arrow putting the value into the object.
*R* objects are only visible when we enter the object name in the _Console_.
```{r,  results='hide'}
x <- 5
x
```

It's like a desk (or Workspace) where we can leave things out of view until we need them.
In RStudio, the _Environment_ tab in the top right shows what's currently in our Environment.  
![The Environment Tab](images/EnvironmentTab.png)

Nothing is saved to disk, until we save the complete Environment as an _.RData_ object.
We can do this by clicking the disk symbol in the Environment Tab, or by entering the code:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
save.image()
```
By default, *R* will save the workspace as a file named `.RData` and this will contain all of the *R* objects you currently have in your workspace (i.e `Environment`)

## RStudio 

### Other Tabs and Features

Next to the `Environment` Tab is the `History` Tab
  
- Contains everything executed in the `Console`
- Useful for when we've been lazy
- Best coding practice is still to enter code in the `Script Window` and execute


In the bottom right are a series of tabs

1. `Files`: This shows your current working directory
2. `Plots`: Every time you make a graph it appears here
3. `Packages`: __NEVER CLICK OR UN-CLICK ANYTHING HERE__
4. `Help`: We'll explore this later


### Cheatsheet and Shortcuts

`Help > Cheatsheets > RStudio IDE Cheat Sheet`

Page 2 has lots of hints:

- `Ctrl + 1` places focus on the Script Window
- `Ctrl + 2` places focus on the Console
- `Ctrl + 3` places focus on the Help Tab

# Data Types

**What is the difference between these two?**

- 7
- "7"  

**Answer**

The first represents the value 7, whilst the second is the character that we use to represent this value as a text symbol.
To your computer these mean different things!

Excel will automatically try to convert "7" to the value 7, but automatic conversion can be troublesome.
(Try entering the gene names for SEPT9, DEC1, FEB2 etc. into Excel.)
In R we maintain control over this delineation.

## The Basic Data Types
The basic (or atomic) data types in R are:

### `logical` (`TRUE` or `FALSE`)
```{r, results='hide'}
x == 5
```

### `integer`
```{r, results='hide'}
sampleSize <- 6
```

### `double` (also known as `numeric`)
```{r}
meanLifeSpan <- 2.05
```
`double` variables get their name from the old days of "single" and "double" precision numbers when computer memory was more limited.
These terms essentially refer to the precision of the values after the decimal point.
Nowadays, any number with a decimal point is generally a "double precision"" value.

### `character`
```{r}
species <- "mouse"
```

**When would you need an integer rather than a double?**

- For count data
- For indexing rows or columns in a `matrix`
- For incrementing through a process in steps

## Vectors
R sees everything as a _vector_
These are like columns in a spreadsheet, where we have entries in multiple cells.
Importantly, _every entry must be of the same data type_!
```{r, results='hide'}
lifeSpans <- c(2.1, 1.9, 1.7, 1.8, 2.3, 2.5)
lifeSpans
```
This is a _numeric_ vector, where all entries are double precision entries (i.e. they have decimal points).  
**What would happen if we accidentally included the letter "a" in this vector?**

- *R* would convert all the numbers to characters, and we would have to convert them back to numbers before proceeding any further.


We can perform simple operations on a vector by using some in-built functions.
Functions in R, consist of their name, followed by the round braces `()`.
We then pass an *R* object to the function, by including it inside these braces.
```{r, results='hide'}
mean(lifeSpans)
```

**Try some other functions**  
Some examples may be `sd()`, `var()`, `max()`, `min()`, `median()`, `summary()`

**Could we apply all of these functions to integer vectors?**  

**What about character vectors?**

Try some if you'd like.
```{r, results='hide'}
int_vec <- 1:5
sd(int_vec)
char_vec<- c("cats", "internet")
min(char_vec)
```
Try the different functions and see what results they give you.
You might see confusing error messages, but remember **error messages are your friend**.
They tell you something isn't right, and (sometimes) give you a clue as to what is wrong, even though they can be frustrating.

In the above, we just printed the results to the screen.
Sometimes we may want to save the results as a new *R* object.
For example, every vector also has a length attribute, which is just the number of entries in the vector, and this can be how we find out our sample size.
```{r, results='hide'}
sampleSize <- length(lifeSpans)
sampleSize
```

## Subsetting Vectors
We can extract single values, or sets of values, from a vector by using square brackets
```{r, results='hide'}
lifeSpans[1]
lifeSpans[4:6]
```


## Factors
One other data type we see in R is a _factor_.
*R* will sometimes assume that any character strings represent categorical variables.
```{r, results='hide'}
Groups <- c("treated", "control", "control", "control", "treated", "treated")
Groups <- factor(Groups)
Groups
```

These can be a trap for the unwary, as behind the scenes *R* has saved these as integers, corresponding to which category (_or factor level_) the values belong to.
```{r, results='hide'}
as.integer(Groups)
```
In one sense, these are like a hybrid of an integer vector, where the values represent the category number, and a character vector which contains the various category names.
In the old days of puny computers, this was more memory efficient.
It also makes sense when you consider statistical modelling is at the heart of R.

## Data Frames
One of the most common data structures in *R* is a `data.frame`.
These are very similar to a spreadsheet in Excel, and we have columns with information in them.
*Each column must be the same length!*
```{r, results='hide'}
mouseLife <- data.frame(lifeSpans, Groups)
mouseLife
```

Note how R automatically named the columns.
We could also specify these manually.
 
```{r, results='hide'}
mouseLife <- data.frame(lifeSpans, Groups,
                        sex  = c("M", "M", "M", "F", "F", "F"))
mouseLife
```

We can easily subset a `data.frame` based on values in a column.

```{r, results='hide'}
subset(mouseLife, sex =="M")
```

We can also call a column individually, using the `$` symbol followed by the column name.

```{r, results='hide'}
mouseLife$Groups
```
