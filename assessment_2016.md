### Assessment Checklist

Have you:

- [ ] Answered all the questions?
- [ ] Followed naming conventions for Assessments?
- [ ] Attached an assessment coversheet?
	- This is a course requirement. See the [Academic Honesty Policy](http://www.adelaide.edu.au/policies/230/).
- [ ] Identified the work as yours?
	- Emails should have the course and assessment task names.
	- Documents should be named with your name, the course name and the assessment task.
	- Printed documents should have you name and the course and assessment task in the text/footer/header.
- [ ] Used appropriate electronic communication with assessors?
	- Emails should have a meaningful subject.
- [ ] Handed in the assignment before the due time (Friday tutorial 10am)?
	
#### Major Project (15%)

In this course, the following next-generation sequencing (NGS) datasets/protocols will be in detail:

1. Whole genome sequencing/Resequencing  
2. Transcriptome Sequencing (RNAseq)
3. DNA Methylation/Bisulfite Sequencing
4. Enrichment/Capture sequencing (Methyl-capture, ChIPseq, RIPseq)
5. Metagenomics/Microbial profiling

Each of these NGS approaches uses similar programs and analysis approaches, such as quality control (quality and sequencing adapter trimming), genome alignment, and downstream visualisation and statistical methods. For the major project, you will take a published dataset and complete all the analysis tasks (from raw data to final results) during the course. 

You have the freedom to choose any dataset you would like before we start week 5's practical (NGS data practical), or choose from four datasets that we have chosen. You will be asked assessment questions on your data during practical assessments throughout the semester, and a final report will be due the week before the end of semester (Week 12)


#### Practical Assignment 1 - Introduction to command-line (9%)

Week 1-2

__Question 1__

Submit the relevant parts of your terminal history (copy-pasting will suffice) for the following commands:

It should be possible for another person to completely reproduce your output from the history you submit.

__Question 2__

At the start of the practical you were told that the following practices should be adopted:

- Do not use spaces in filenames.
- Extensively comment your code with meaningful comments.
- Use robust error handling.
- Report version numbers of programs used.
- Use sensible variable names.
- File checks: Checking if your code is valid and runs successfully.
	
In a long-format question, explain why  these practices are important?

The following articles will help you understand the importance of some of these.
Others may take some thought, discussion with other students or careful questions.
